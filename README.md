Tor Network Detection by using  machine learning and artificial  neural network
 The goal of the project is to determine whether network traffic belongs to the Tor network using machine learning and artificial neural networks.

The process begins with data analysis on a given dataset to gain insights. Categorical values in the dataset are converted into numerical values to facilitate learning. Normalization is then applied to the dataset, scaling all features between -1 and 1. Various classification algorithms, such as K Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes Classifiers, Random Decision Forest, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and artificial neural networks are employed to estimate whether future traffic belongs to the Tor network based on past data.

After each algorithm is applied, evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to compare the performance of the models on the dataset. The goal is to determine which model performs better in identifying Tor network traffic.
